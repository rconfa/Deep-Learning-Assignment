# Deep-Learning-Assignment
A repository of assignments performed during the Advanced Machine Learning course. 

## 1. FeedForward Neural Network

[FFNN Folder](Assignment1-FFNN/)

The assignment consists in the prediction of default payments using a feed Forward Neural Network.

The provided dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005 (X_train, Y_train). This two dataset can be used for training the FFNN, and eventually for the validation. This dataset can be used to test model prediction.


[Regularization&Autoencoder Folder](Assignment2-Regularization&Autoencoder/)

The assignment consists in the prediction of grayscale images of handwritten letters P - Z with a traditional neural network (FFNN) with the right regularization. It's also require to build a simple auto-encoder model and investigating visually the reconstruction abilities of such an architecture, and optional the use and evaluation of the encoded representation generated by the auto-encoder to solve the problem of supervised classification.

The Dataset consists of 14000 training labelled images and 8800 test images.
