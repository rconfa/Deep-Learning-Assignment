# Deep-Learning-Assignment
A repository of assignments performed during the Advanced Machine Learning course. 

## 1. FeedForward Neural Network

[FFNN Folder](Assignment1-FFNN/)

The assignment consists in the prediction of default payments using a feed Forward Neural Network.

The provided dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005 (X_train, Y_train). This two dataset can be used for training the FFNN, and eventually for the validation. This dataset can be used to test model prediction.
